[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thebehera/mqtt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thebehera/mqtt)


This is currently a WIP project with the goal of creating a lightweight, highly-performant, zero-copy(when available), MQTT3.1.1 & 5 easy to use library with two simple APIs (Sync & Authentication)

Please do not attempt to use this in production. It's simply not ready. 

# Min Requirements

# Test Status (>1528 tests as of now)
Currently most of the tests are unit tests and there are some integration tests validating that we can connect to a mosquitto server
