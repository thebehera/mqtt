             * If the Server accepts a connection with CleanSession set to 0, the value set in Session Present depends
             * on whether the Server already has stored Session state for the supplied client ID. If the Server has
             * stored Session state, it MUST set Session Present to 1 in the CONNACK packet [MQTT-3.2.2-2]. If the
             * Server does not have stored Session state, it MUST set Session Present to 0 in the CONNACK packet. This

             * The Session Present flag enables a Client to establish whether the Client and Server have a consistent
             * view about whether there is already stored Session state.
             *
             * Once the initial setup of a Session is complete, a Client with stored Session state will expect the
             * Server to maintain its stored Session state. In the event that the value of Session Present received
             * by the Client from the Server is not as expected, the Client can choose whether to proceed with the
             * Session or to disconnect. The Client can discard the Session state on both Client and Server by
             * disconnecting, connecting with Clean Session set to 1 and then disconnecting again.
