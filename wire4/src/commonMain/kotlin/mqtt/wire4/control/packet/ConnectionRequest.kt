         * Non normative comment
         *
         * Typically, a Client will always connect using CleanSession set to 0 or CleanSession set to 1 and not
         * swap between the two values. The choice will depend on the application. A Client using CleanSession
         * set to 1 will not receive old Application Messages and has to subscribe afresh to any topics that it
         * is interested in each time it connects. A Client using CleanSession set to 0 will receive all QoS 1
         * or QoS 2 messages that were published while it was disconnected. Hence, to ensure that you do not
         * lose messages while disconnected, use QoS 1 or QoS 2 with CleanSession set to 0.
         *
         * Non normative comment
         *
         * When a Client connects with CleanSession set to 0, it is requesting that the Server maintain its
         * MQTT session state after it disconnects. Clients should only connect with CleanSession set to 0,
         * if they intend to reconnect to the Server at some later point in time. When a Client has determined
         * that it has no further use for the session it should do a final connect with CleanSession set to 1

         * that they hold relating to this MQTT Session between the Client and the Server [MQTT-3.1.3-2].
         *
         * The Client Identifier (ClientId) MUST be present and MUST be the first field in the CONNECT packet
         * payload [MQTT-3.1.3-3].
         *
         * The ClientId MUST be a UTF-8 encoded string as defined in Section 1.5.3 [MQTT-3.1.3-4].
         *
         * The Server MUST allow ClientIds which are between 1 and 23 UTF-8 encoded bytes in length, and that
         * contain only the characters
         *
         * "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" [MQTT-3.1.3-5].
         *
         * The Server MAY allow ClientId’s that contain more than 23 encoded bytes. The Server MAY allow
         * ClientId’s that contain characters not included in the list given above.
         *
         * A Server MAY allow a Client to supply a ClientId that has a length of zero bytes, however if it does
         * so the Server MUST treat this as a special case and assign a unique ClientId to that Client. It MUST
         * then process the CONNECT packet as if the Client had provided that unique ClientId [MQTT-3.1.3-6].
         *
         * If the Client supplies a zero-byte ClientId, the Client MUST also set CleanSession to 1 [MQTT-3.1.3-7].
         *
         * If the Client supplies a zero-byte ClientId with CleanSession set to 0, the Server MUST respond to the
         * CONNECT Packet with a CONNACK return code 0x02 (Identifier rejected) and then close the Network
         * Connection [MQTT-3.1.3-8].
         *
         * If the Server rejects the ClientId it MUST respond to the CONNECT Packet with a CONNACK return code
         * 0x02 (Identifier rejected) and then close the Network Connection [MQTT-3.1.3-9].
         *
         * Non normative comment
         *
         * A Client implementation could provide a convenience method to generate a random ClientId. Use of such a
         * method should be actively discouraged when the CleanSession is set to 0.
